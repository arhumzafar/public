### Public Setup

*Arhum Zafar - 2025*

I've switched laptops/machines 3 times in the past calendar year -- *I know, not great*.

However, as someone that still writes a lot of Python, C++, & Rust, getting the entire DEV setup back to what it normally looks like each time I get a new laptop is a nightmare and way too time consuming. 

I created this script such that whenever I get a new computer **or** need to reset my setup, I can immediately pull this down and run this script. 

```
./setup.sh
```
or
```
bash setup.sh
```
or, if you're unaware of what directory you're currently in, and want to run the script regardless: 
```
chmod +x /path/to/setup.sh
./path/to/setup.sh
```

Perhaps you can tweak it towards whatever your development setup looks like.
